"""
Shared constants for scoring formulas, aggregation thresholds, and limits.

These values were previously inlined as magic numbers in individual
handlers. Audit item 27 called out the readability + tunability cost of
scattering them; this module collects the ones that have cross-handler
meaning so the formulas become self-documenting.

Rule of thumb for what belongs here:
- A number that appears in more than one file OR
- A number whose meaning is not obvious from context AND changing it
  requires a coordinated review across files.

If a number is truly local to one function (e.g. a retry count tuned to a
specific API's throttling behavior), leave it inline with a comment.
