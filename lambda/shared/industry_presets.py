"""
Single source of truth for industry preset metadata.

Both ``search/brand_extractor.py`` (the LLM extraction pipeline) and
``api/manage-brand-config.py`` (the dashboard settings API) need the same
industry catalog. Previously each file declared its own ``INDUSTRY_PRESETS``
dict; the two copies drifted in shape (the API version baked a
``default_prompt`` string into every entry, computed from the other fields).

This module holds the structural data. Handlers that need the
``default_prompt`` derive it at request time from the helper they already
own — that keeps this module free of API-specific presentation concerns and
avoids pulling the prompt-template scaffolding into the extraction Lambda.
