"""
Environment variable resolution with legacy-name migration support.

Historical context: the project accumulated three DynamoDB table env-var
naming conventions — bare names (``SEARCH_RESULTS_TABLE``), prefixed names
(``DYNAMODB_TABLE_SEARCH_RESULTS``), and a mix of suffixed variants
(``CITATIONS_TABLE_NAME``). Audit item 12 called this out as a deploy
footgun: renaming any handler's env-var requires a coordinated CDK deploy
or Python/CDK go out of sync and the Lambda can't cold-start.

This helper reads the canonical ``DYNAMODB_TABLE_*`` name first and falls
back to any legacy names passed in. That means:

- Python code can be deployed independently of CDK (new name first).
- CDK can set both old and new env vars during the transition so any
  Lambda version works with any stack version.
- Once every handler has migrated, the transitional mapping in CDK can
  be cleaned up and this helper's fallback path becomes dead code —
  at which point the legacy-name list can be removed from each caller.

Keep this module tiny and dependency-free so it can live in the shared
layer and import cheaply at cold-start.
