Brand Mention Extractor

Uses LLM (Bedrock) to intelligently extract brand mentions from search responses.
Supports multiple industries with configurable extraction prompts and brand tracking.

Classification is done entirely by the LLM using brand examples as guidelines,
not exact string matching. This allows the LLM to understand brand hierarchies
(e.g., sub-brands belonging to parent companies).
